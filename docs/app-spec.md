# Family Office — Product Specification

## Overview

**Project Name:** `familyoffice.brianrosenthal.org` (it will live there for now and primarily serve my family)

### Mission

Family Office is a collaborative household management application whose primary purpose is ensuring that important recurring responsibilities are never forgotten.

Unlike a traditional task manager, Family Office is centered around **long-term recurring obligations** rather than one-time tasks. It serves as the family's institutional memory, keeping track of obligations, assets, important documents, insurance policies, maintenance schedules, and trusted contacts.

The application is designed for families rather than professional financial offices.

# Core Design Philosophy

The application revolves around one central concept:

> **Recurring Obligations**

Everything else (assets, documents, insurance policies, vendors, family members, etc.) exists primarily to support these obligations.

Examples:

- Renew passport
- Pay property taxes
- Replace HVAC filter
- Annual physical
- Quarterly investment review
- Renew umbrella insurance
- Clean gutters

Every recurring obligation answers four questions:

- What needs to happen?
- When is it due?
- Who is responsible?
- What information is needed to complete it?

# 4. Contacts

- Insurance agents
- Contractors
- Plumbers
- Electricians
- HVAC companies

## Relationships

Contacts should be linkable to other records in the system.

Examples:

- A family member can be linked to a health obligation.
- A doctor can be linked to an annual physical reminder.
- A dentist can be linked to a dental cleaning reminder.
- An attorney can be linked to estate planning documents.
- An insurance agent can be linked to an insurance policy.
- A plumber can be linked to a household asset or maintenance task.
- A school can be linked to a child or family member.

## Design Notes

Contacts should be useful as a standalone directory, not merely as supporting data for reminders.

A single contact may have multiple categories or roles.

For example:

- A person may be both a trusted neighbor and an emergency contact.
- A company may be both an HVAC provider and a plumber.
- A doctor may be both a physician and a family contact.

The UI should allow filtering contacts by category so the user can quickly view groups such as:

- Family
- Doctors
- Legal / Financial
- Insurance
- Home Services
- Emergency
